%Several people have expressed an interest in the table macros which
%I purported to have. They appear below. They do *not* work in LaTeX;
%however after looking at the supertab macros for LaTeX (which several
%people told me about), I think that I could modifify them to work 
%with LaTeX. Any one who wishes to convert them feel free as I won't
%have the time to do this until the end of August.
 
%The basic macros were written primarily by Bob Howlett 
%(howlett_r@maths.su.oz.au), with me watching and making the odd 
%suggestion and modification. Consequently I have called the macros
%the "btable.sty" macros. All credit should go to Bob.
 
%The macros were written to typeset large character tables and 
%consequently everything is put into math mode. To take them out of
%math mode the definitions of \tableline and \nextbit need to  be
%changed in the obvious way (ie. remove the "$"s).
 
%The reason why I wanted these macros was that TeX and LaTeX both
%spat the dummy and gave a memory overflow when I asked them to
%do my tables by conventional methods. I also tried using the
%tabular environment in LaTeX; butm for reasons which I can't 
%comprehend (or through ill-use?), there seems to be a limit of 
%approximately 15 columns in this evironment  - I needed up to
%31 columns. Given this limit, the supertab environment written for LaTeX 
%has the same restriction (it uses the tabular environment), and
%so it would be worthwhile to convert these macros to LaTeX (they
%don't work in LaTeX at the moment because \plainoutput is not 
%defined in LaTeX).
 
%These macros do not appear to have any memory restrictions: I ran
%what turned out to be 22 pages of 31 column tables through TeX in
%one hit without any complaints. As such they meet my specifications -
%I hope that they also met yours.

%        place; while you're, at it, why not hug a friend!

%%% Table Format:                                                
%%  All entries are formatted in math mode. A horizontal line
%%  is placed under the table header, and a vertical line
%%  separates the first and second columns. The first column
%%  is left justified and all other columns are right justified.
%%  Any row can have an arbitrary number of columns. The macros were
%%  designed for TeXing character tables.
%%% Table Syntax:
% - table begun with \starttable
% - columns separated by &
% - each row ended by &!
% - last row of table ended by &* and followed by \endtable
% - table header specified by \tableheader ...&!
% - if a blank line is wanted in the table put !\gap at the 
%   end of the row
% - to force a page break put !\pagegap at end of row
% - pages are  broken naturally if \pagegap is not used, and the
%   table header is put at the top of the following page.
%%% Column spacing
% - nameskip:   width of the title column
% - colSkip:    width of the columns                 
% - colsep:     separation between columns
% - firstcol:   extra space to the left of the first column (in my 
%       character tables the the first column (as distinct from the
%       left-most column which "labels" each row), contains the 
%       degrees of the characters which are often very large numbers
%       and so I needed more space: eg. psi | xxxxxxx  xxxx  xxxx ...).
\def\nameskip{\kern30pt}
\def\colskip{\kern20pt}       
\def\colsep{\kern3pt}
\def\firstcol{\kern10pt}
%%% Known bug
%   If the row ends with ...& &! then the next row may be
%   added to the end of this row. This can be avoided 
%   by typing  ...&\relax&! instead.
%%  Useful note:
%   set \hsize=\wd0 to make the page width equal the table width
